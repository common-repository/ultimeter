Ultimeter - the Ultimate Progress and Goals Meter

== Description ==

Ultimeter uses a simple shortcode, widget or block, to display a choice of different meters (a thermometer and a progress bar in the Lite version, with three more added in the Pro version). It then allows you to choose between percentage or currency units (with heaps more metrics in the Pro version). You can specify the total (goal) amount, as well as the total raised (progress) amount. You can even choose the colour of the meter, to keep it in line with your own styles.

== Features ==

* Choice of 3 meters
* Change the colours to suit your branding
* Control alignment and size
* Set goal and current values
* Choice of either percentage or currency units
* Automatic formatting of currency values
* Choice of currency unit
* Duplicate meters easily
* Multiple meters per page or site
* Insert using a shortcode or a block

== Pro Features ==

* Many more meter designs, including a radial meter, a vertical progress bar, and a range of inline and text-based meters.
* A third measurement unit with custom values - takes a singular and plural form, i.e. boxes, bags etc.
* Ability to add custom CSS to make even more style changes.
* A new set of Infinite Meters that count up indefinitely.
* The ability to upload your own image to use as a meter. This could be a photo, or your company logo.
